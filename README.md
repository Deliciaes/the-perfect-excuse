# Code Review

Code review written by Amanda Hult√©n.

1. `style.css` - Don't forget to use variables for your colors to easier access them if changes occur. This can be done with the :root-element.  
2. `style.css:30-32` - Instead of writing the margins on seperate lines, you could write margin: top right bottom left. In your case it would be margin: 40px 10px 0 10px.
3. `index.html:117-120` - Remember to always have your script-tags inside the body, most commonly in the end of the body.  Otherwise, the document is considered invalid. (The browsers these days will often fix problems when placed outside, but it's not good practice). 
4. `style.css` - To get a more efficient code you could also use the :root-element to set your font-sizes.
5. `index.html: 10` - The html-tag should only have two children: head and body. Therefore you can't have your h1-tag outside those two children. It should be inside the body-tag. 
6. You have really good comments, especially in your js-files, wich gives me a good overview of your code - well done!
